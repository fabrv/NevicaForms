# SalmonPier
SalmonPier (temp. name) is an app for data collection in field. We hope to help researchers with a pretty, light-weight, and easy to use app that will make data collection easier, faster and more reliable.
Every step of the project is made with extensive usability testing with the aim to make it as intuitive as possible.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites
[Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), make sure you install the LTS version.
To verify you have succesfully installed node run this on the terminal (or console).
```
node -v
```

Once that's done, install Ionic Framework by running this command on the terminal (or console). [Check Ionic Docs for more info](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/).
```
npm install -g ionic cordova
```
To verify you have succesfully installed ionic run this on the terminal (or console).
